# Sorting-Algorithms

Once you downloaded the entire code, make sure that "src" and "rsrc" folders exist.
Then you can run the code by "gcc -o main main.c sorting_alg.c" and "./main".
All results will be stored in "src" folder and you can generate new randomfile.txt by running the program and pressing "11" on the menu.
Enjoy!
